Last updated: 2026-06-12 (#72 complete — branch 72-aria-accent-picker-preselect, pending merge)

## Current phase

Phase 4 — Feature-complete. Open source launch prep complete.

## Last closed

- #72 (Aria): Accent color picker focus-on-open now lands on the swatch matching the
  model's current color, not always Amber (index 0).
  - `firstSwatchRef` renamed to `initialFocusRef`
  - `initialFocusIndex` computed via `SWATCHES.findIndex` matching `selectedHex`
    case-insensitively; falls back to 0 if current color is a custom hex not in swatches
  - `useLayoutEffect` unchanged — still calls `initialFocusRef.current?.focus()`

## Decisions made this session

- No design gaps; Luma's spec implied "focus should follow selection" — fix is mechanical.
- The `selectedHex` state initializes from `currentColor ?? SWATCHES[0].hex` (pre-existing),
  so `initialFocusIndex` is derived from the already-correct starting selection value.
  No additional state needed.

## Gotchas

- Single-PR rule on types/index.ts — no concurrent Arch PRs
- StorageConfig is NOT in types/index.ts — it's in @/storage/storageFactory.ts
- applyUserAccentColors must be called after EVERY applyTheme() — wired at boot and
  in handleThemeChange in Sidebar.tsx
- VALID_MODEL_IDS in /src/auth/accentColors.ts must stay in sync with ModelId union
- VALID_MODEL_IDS also in /src/auth/modelVersion.ts — update both when adding models
- getActiveStorageProvider() is the App.tsx entry point for provider injection
- Backend uses ESLint 9 flat config (eslint.config.mjs) — not .eslintrc.json
- getSessionTokenUsage(), buildDefaultModelConfigs(), MODEL_REGISTRY from @/models — documented cross-agent exceptions for Aria
- App.tsx lives outside /src/ui — Aria may update it only to thread UI props/hooks
- Gemini API key goes in URL as ?key= — Google REST API pattern, not a header
- Gemini model string is now in the URL path via buildGeminiUrl() — not a body field
- Adding new models: update MODEL_REGISTRY in /src/models/registry.ts — UI auto-updates
- /auth/refresh does NOT invalidate the previous token — both tokens valid until expiry
- npm audit reports 4 pre-existing vulns (3 moderate, 1 critical) in esbuild/vite chain —
  fix requires Vite v8 upgrade (breaking change), not in current scope
- vitest-axe axe-core assertion pattern: use assertNoViolations(results) helper
- aria-controls: panels must always be in DOM (hidden attr, not conditional render)
- prefers-reduced-motion: streaming shimmers use per-model selectors — must override each
- brand-tokens.css uses [data-mode] attribute set by applyTheme() — brand logo color only
  works correctly once applyTheme() has run (which happens before first render in main.tsx)
- SIDEBAR_WIDTH_MIN is 278; Aria's drag UI must enforce this same floor
- Mobile sidebar: isMobileViewport.current only checked at mount. Resize mobile→desktop
  without reload leaves inline-style guard in mobile mode. Acceptable.
- Tailwind: `relative` and `fixed` conflict (relative comes later in stylesheet). Always
  scope `relative` to `md:relative` on elements that use `fixed` for mobile positioning.
